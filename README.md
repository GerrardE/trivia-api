## Trivia

This app will help team members hold trivia on a regular basis. I created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. 

Current available features:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains the completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. 

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
